<h1>Cruise Ships GUI</h1>

Cruise Ships GUI is a JavaScript project that simulates the movement of a cruise ship as it travels between different ports. It is built upon the Cruise Ships project, and it provides users with an interactive user interface to add ports to a ship's itinerary and set sail.

<h2>How to run the simulation</h2>

To run the simulation, open the index.html file in a web browser. This will load the simulation interface.

To start the simulation, you need to add at least two ports to the itinerary using the form. Simply enter a name for the new port in the input field and click the "Add" button. If the name is valid and not already in the itinerary, the new port will be added.

Once you have done this, you can click the "Set Sail!" button, and the ship will start moving towards the next port on the itinerary. The headsUp element will display the name of the current port and the next port on the itinerary, and you can watch as the ship moves gradually towards its destination.

If you reach the end of the itinerary, a message will be displayed on the simulation viewport to indicate that the ship has completed its voyage.
