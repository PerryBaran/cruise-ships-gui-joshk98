<h1>Cruise Ships GUI</h1>

Cruise Ships GUI is a JavaScript project that simulates the movement of a cruise ship as it travels between different ports. It is built upon the Cruise Ships project, and it provides users with an interactive user interface to add ports to a ship's itinerary and set sail.

<h2>How to run the simulation</h2>

To run the simulation, open the index.html file in a web browser. This will load the simulation interface, which contains a few different elements:

    headsUp: This displays the name of the current port and the next port on the itinerary.

    addPortForm: This is a form that allows you to add new ports to the itinerary. Simply enter a name for the new port in the input field and click the "Add" button. If the name is valid and not already in the itinerary, the new port will be added.

    viewport: This is the main display area for the simulation. It contains two main elements:

    ports: This displays a list of all the ports currently on the itinerary, as well as any new ports that are added using the addPortForm.

    ship: This displays an image of the ship, and it moves between ports as the simulation progresses.

To start the simulation, you need to add at least two ports to the itinerary. Once you have done this, you can click the "Set Sail!" button, and the ship will start moving towards the next port on the itinerary. The headsUp element will display the name of the current port and the next port on the itinerary, and you can watch as the ship moves gradually towards its destination.

If you reach the end of the itinerary, a message will be displayed on the simulation viewport to indicate that the ship has completed its voyage.
