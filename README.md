<h1>Cruise Ships GUI</h1>

A JavaScript project has been developed to simulate the movement of a cruise ship as it travels between various ports. It builds upon the Cruise Ships project and offers users an engaging interface to add ports to a ship's itinerary and embark on a voyage.

<h2>How to run the simulation<h2>

To run the simulation, open the HTML file in a web browser. You can add new ports by entering a name in the input field and clicking the "Add Port" button. Once you have added at least two ports, you can click the "Sail" button to start the simulation. The ship will move gradually towards the next port, and the headsUp element will display the name of the current port and the next port. If you reach the end of the itinerary, a message will be displayed on the simulation viewport.
